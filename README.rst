DWI Preprocessing and Connectome Reconstruction
=================================================


Overview
--------

This repository provides tools and pipelines for preprocessing diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) data and reconstructing structural connectomes. The workflow is designed for multimodal dMRI datasets and supports advanced techniques for noise reduction, artifact correction, and connectome generation.



Features
--------

- **Preprocessing**: Denoising, motion correction, susceptibility distortion correction, and bias field correction.
- **Reconstruction**: Tractography and connectome generation on pre-processed dMRI data.
- **Modularity**: Scripts for local run or HPC run.
- **Compatibility**: NIfTI, BIDS data format.
